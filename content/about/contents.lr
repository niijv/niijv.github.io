###... me
My name is Elias Zeitfogel and I am, among many other things, interested in computer graphics / vision, social network analysis, machine learning, data science, web development and learning new skills. In my free time I like to do obstacle races and go mountain biking. 

 I graduated from the [University of Technology Graz](http://www.tugraz.at) where I studied *Computer Science* and *Software Development and Business Management*. Some of my work there has been published in the paper [Evolution of Reddit: From the Front Page of the Internet to a Self-referential Community?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1386) at the [World Wide Web Conference 2014](http://www2014.kr/) in Seoul, Korea.

I also do a lot of freelancing, some projects I worked on can be viewed [here](../references). 

###... this website

After finishing my studies I finally found time to dive into [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python microframework, and the initial version of this website is the result of that endeavour. The website was originally created with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (including various extensions) and some [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and was hosted on a free tier of [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). It offers a basic CMS with some simple models for blogs, project references or professional milestones and an admin dashboard. You are free to fork it on [GitHub](https://github.com/niijv/webvita) or use the [version](https://github.com/niijv/webvita-heroku) I prepared for [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). 
But shortly after that another project by the creator of Flask piqued my interest. Enter [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com). After contributing to the project myself and watching it get open-sourced and publicly released a few months later with great success I was determined to stick with it. And what better way to do that than using it for your own website.
